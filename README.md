# Base Apparel coming soon page

This is my solution to the [frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0 "Base Apparel coming soon page challenge - frontendmentor.io") challenge, it was begginer-friendly webpage to create. I made it with **HTML5** and vanilla **CSS3**.
